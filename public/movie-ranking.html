<h1>The Best Movies According to Mega</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time!</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Prisoners</h3>
<p>This is a thriller movie about a father who is trying to solve a mystery of his missing daugther. My favorite thriller movie.</p>
<h3>Pee Mak</h3>
<p>This is my favorite comedy horror movie. It is a Thai movie and is one of the best comedy movie out there. If you want a good time and a good laugh, watch this movie. And expect some emotional tears towards the end of the movie.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is an epic sci-fi movie. This movie is about time and space and it definetly the kind of movie that makes you use your brain (hint: physics lover).</p>
